# Lord of the Rings Trivia (Web API Practice)

## Description

This repository is comprised of an HTML, JavaScript, and two CSS files. One CSS file is a reset file to reduce browser inconsistencies and the other is the style sheet for the page. 

The page consists of a trivia game. The initial screen shows a title, brief instructions, and a start button. The user has 15 seconds for each question. Once the start button is pressed, the first question and its multiple answer choices are shown on the screen. The user can select their answer by clicking on the desired answer button. Their correct/incorrect result will be displayed on the page and the next question/answers will appear. Each incorrect answer deducts 10 seconds from the countdown timer.

This page is slightly responsive to smaller window sizes, but could use additional styling to provide better responsiveness.

The trivia can end in two ways - (1) the user runs out of time or (2) the user completes all the questions. If the user runs out of time, they may choose to play the game again. If the user completes all the questions, the end screen appears which displays the user's score and allows for the user to input their name into the leaderboard. 

This project focuses on the use DOM manipulation, Web API, localStorage, dynamic HTML editing, functions, conditional statements, click events, and scope. These concepts were needed to create the functionalities that started the trivia, checked answers, stored users' information, displayed information, and iterated through the questions.
